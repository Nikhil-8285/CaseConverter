# CaseConverter App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

**CaseConverter** is a powerful and user-friendly web application that allows users to convert text between various letter cases, count words and characters, and more. Whether you're looking to change text to uppercase, lowercase, or other formats, the app provides a seamless experience. Additional features include copying text to the clipboard, reading text aloud, and showing how long it would take a human to read the text. It's an all-in-one tool for text manipulation and analysis.

## Features

- **Convert Uppercase/Lowercase**: Easily convert your text to uppercase or lowercase.
- **Text Preview**: See the converted text in real-time with a live preview.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy the converted text to your clipboard for easy use in other applications.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Let the app read the text aloud for accessibility or convenience.
- **Word and Character Count**: Get the total number of words and characters in your text.
- **Reading Time Estimation**: The app estimates how long it would take a human to read the provided text based on an average reading speed.
